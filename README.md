## Examples

### 1- Returns the Turkish meanings of the English word 

If you want to bring the Turkish meanings of an English word you want in pageable format in JSON type, request as below.  As an example, the word **hello** is used.
  
The only thing needed here is the word you want to search. Other values are up to you. Parentheses represent default values.  
**page** = Page number (1),     
**size** = Number of element each page(10),    
**sort** = Sort by XX(id)  
**order** = Ascending or Descending(asc),  
**word** = Represents the searched word.

```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8085/translate?order=asc&page=1&size=10&sort=id&word=word" -H "accept: */*"
```
Example output : 

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "id": 635276,
      "word_en": "hello",
      "word_tr": "merhaba",
      "category": "Common Usage",
      "type": "interjection"
    },
    {
      "id": 635277,
      "word_en": "hello",
      "word_tr": "merhaba",
      "category": "General",
      "type": "interjection"
    },
    {
      "id": 635278,
      "word_en": "hello",
      "word_tr": "selam",
      "category": "General",
      "type": "interjection"
    },
    {
      "id": 635279,
      "word_en": "hello",
      "word_tr": "alo",
      "category": "General",
      "type": "interjection"
    },
    {
      "id": 635280,
      "word_en": "hello",
      "word_tr": "merhabalar",
      "category": "Speaking",
      "type": "noun"
    }
  ],
  "pageable": {
    "sort": {
      "sorted": true,
      "unsorted": false,
      "empty": false
    },
    "pageNumber": 0,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "offset": 0,
    "paged": true,
    "unpaged": false
  },
  "totalPages": 1,
  "totalElements": 5,
  "last": true,
  "sort": {
    "sorted": true,
    "unsorted": false,
    "empty": false
  },
  "size": 10,
  "number": 0,
  "numberOfElements": 5,
  "first": true,
  "empty": false
}
```
### 2- Returns the Turkish meanings of the English word 
Here, the same process above is repeated. But the output here will be different from the one above. The output contains only one list structure. It does not offer a paginated format. This method is **not recommended**. If the word you request has hundreds of meanings, your waiting time will be longer.
```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8085/translate/hello" -H "accept: */*"
```
Example output : 

```json
[
  {
    "id": 635276,
    "word_en": "hello",
    "word_tr": "merhaba",
    "category": "Common Usage",
    "type": "interjection"
  },
  {
    "id": 635277,
    "word_en": "hello",
    "word_tr": "merhaba",
    "category": "General",
    "type": "interjection"
  },
  {
    "id": 635278,
    "word_en": "hello",
    "word_tr": "selam",
    "category": "General",
    "type": "interjection"
  },
  {
    "id": 635279,
    "word_en": "hello",
    "word_tr": "alo",
    "category": "General",
    "type": "interjection"
  },
  {
    "id": 635280,
    "word_en": "hello",
    "word_tr": "merhabalar",
    "category": "Speaking",
    "type": "noun"
  }
]
```
